## Biography
<p>Associate Professor, Master Supervisor, Deputy Director of IoT Engineering Department of Shenzhen Technology University (SZTU). He received the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology. He has developed several 5G NB-IoT algorithms with "technical breaking points" for commercial implementation at Huawei. As a faculty member of SZTU (officially established in 2018, which aims to produce talents in applied sciences with market orientation, to adhere to the characteristics of school enterprise cooperation and to encourage students to practice and innovation), he has presided over 11 scientific research projects with the funding about 4.3 million yuan and participated in 3 key scientific research projects with the funding 4 million yuan as a core member. The projects mainly focus on the analysis and modeling of node mobility characteristics in low-power IoT, transmission optimization of low-power mobile networks and innovative IoT applications. Some of the research results have been converted into 16 intellectual property rights, and some of the research results have been published in international high-level journals such as Wireless Networks, and Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing.
He has guided more than 100 students in innovation activities, and won 4 national awards, 9 provincial awards, and 1 school level excellent graduation thesis as the first or main instructor. He has won such honors as National Excellent Tutor in the National Undergraduate IoT Design Contest, and First Teacher Crystal Award in SZTU.</p>
